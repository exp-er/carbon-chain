## Aim 
Evaluating and measuring carbon footprint for blockchain operations and researching carbon credits and its role for investment with an carbon-based indexing framework. 

## Objectives 
- Measuring and evaluating carbon emission due to consensus algorithm 
- Measuring and evaluating carbon emission due to use-cases 
- Design changes and sustainable operations for different use-cases. 
- Role of participant nodes in carbon footprint for an organisation 
- Carbon credit framework for blockchain 
- Carbon footprint and carbon credit smart contract design 
- Carbon indexing framework development and testing procedure. 
- Application and future scope 

## Questions 
- Is it possible to design a framework for carbon footprint on blockchain based companies? 
- What are the factors that are not evaluated through technical methods? How to evaluate these methods through internal or external methods? 
- What role does transparency and immutability play in carbon footprint using blockchain operations? 
- How feasible are carbon credits for the future? What is hampering its development? What innovations can help to reduce the growth? 
- Are carbon footprint based indexes feasible for investments? What factors are included for the index? 
- Do smart contract design strategies for sustainable development and processing apply to most use-cases? 
- What is the future for carbon credits, carbon-based indexes using carbon footprints and sustainability with blockchain?
