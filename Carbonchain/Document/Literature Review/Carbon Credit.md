In accordance with the Paris Agreement mentioned before, the plausible solution to reducing
carbon emissions on a national level was to add a controlling factor. The control factor could be
through companies paying a tax for their emissions, or add a limit to emissions on the companies,
which can be reduced sustainably over time, or introducing a trading scheme for emissions and
sustainability. The trading scheme for emissions was coined carbon cap-and-trade scheme or
CAT. [13] This scheme is used in the form of carbon credits, with specific metric to evaluate how
many credits correspond to how much emission. The credits can be traded between companies
or markets to develop a more sustainable future with proper estimated carbon emission and
usage, inclusive of other greenhouse gases and emissions that can affect climate change. The
existence of blockchain technology points towards permission-less carbon markets that can be
used for exchange and production of carbon credits to organisation through smart contracts that
work automatically based on evaluated results of an organisation. [14] This reduces unfairness
and fraud, while being automated makes it time-efficient for continuous production and gives
pathways for better analysis due to blockchain based supply-chain introduction that can point
out exact step of higher emissions that can be improved on to be more sustainable. [15]
Carbon credits also pave the path as incentives for developers and innovators due to direct
profits that can be attained through these credits which can be transacted in voluntary market,
invested into companies or exchanged for different tokens on existing blockchain. [4] These
financial incentives also work directly in an organization, as the previous trade-off between
current and sustainable approach was usually surrounded by corporate responsibilities and
sustainable development for future development, tackling climate change, etc. The carbon
credits provide an instant benefit for using sustainable methods, where the value of carbon
credits may change with time, its function can be transferred from organisations as it becomes
sustainable to organisations that are not, for its continuous processing. [4]
The process for earning carbon credits include simple reduction of carbon from the climate
through plantation or other emerging technologies, while the reduction can be directly com-
pensated, other ways of earning carbon credits provide better incentives, including technologies
leading to reduction in emission leads to earning carbon credits through a regulatory framework,
this can be for current projects and future projects. Even though, there is green-washing, which
is companies that trade carbon credits for their emission and continue their work. Companies
that are zero-carbon emission can also earn carbon credits based on their methods and sustain-
able approaches as incentives for other companies to go carbon-zero or carbon-negative in the
future.
