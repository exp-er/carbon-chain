Carbon footprint is the procedure to calculate an organization’s carbon emissions throughout its
essential operations’ life-cycle, assisting towards its reduction and innovation to improve towards
more sustainable operations. Considering and constraining to blockchain technologies, it is
possible to calculate energy consumption for each block transaction, and given its transparency
and traceability, an automated model that calculates the carbon footprint on the transactions
can be calculated. [9] While a sustainable approach towards the consensus algorithm design
and the energy consumption and emission for each would help in evaluating the carbon foot
print and sustainability for operations on particular blockchain.[10]
The Paris agreement with legal framework to be referenced by nations regarding carbon
emissions and the European Green Deal, enacted to achieve climate neutrality and many other
such initiatives, has lead to a shift in digital transformation. Innovation for any future technol-
ogy requires a sustainability clause for the current standard of operations and a future scope with
improved sustainability, other factors remain constant, including efficiency and adaptability.[3]
Considering blockchain technologies, given its identity as an energy-hungry operation due to the
popularity of mining with PoW algorithm, require a more sustainable approach towards building
blockchain organisation. An essential part of blockchain is in the consensus algorithm that it is
based for functionality, a comparative study of these algorithm lead to a better understanding
towards sustainable improvements and the effect of the changes on use-cases. [11]
The use-cases of blockchain can lead to a different consumption level for carbon footprint. As
the operations in the blockchain, do not depend entirely on the consensus algorithm, the smart
contract and its efficiency with time and space, the network and number of core and participant
nodes, permission and permission-less blockchain with their benefits and shortcomings all play
a weighed role in managing and evaluating the carbon footprint, which can be divided into hard
and soft factors. [3]

Carbon footprint evaluation also contributes towards UN sustainability goals, as each orga-
nization based on blockchain can edge towards being more sustainable compared to the compe-
tition to be evaluated higher, or even for existing organisations to adopt blockchain frameworks
into their operations for smoother functionality with higher sustainability. [12] These improve-
ments increase evaluation for organisation that act as opportunities on a balanced way for both
the organisation and investors. Climate change has posed lots of challenges for various sectors,
while these challenges include opportunities for the path for profitable applications that can be
invested in, hence acting as incentive for organisations to focus on sustainability as innovation.
These improvements make such organisation better for portfolios for a cleaner future.
