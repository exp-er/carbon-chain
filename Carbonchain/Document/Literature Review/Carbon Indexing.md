As mentioned before, carbon footprint, carbon credits and sustainable improvements can act as
incentives for organisations and investors. Sustainability is a mandatory responsibility for an
6
organisation to exist, manage and serve the end-user in any form. The climate change initiatives
that are undertaken for the future, contain sustainability goals and approaches, while at the
same time, hamper organisation to affect climate change in the near future due to climate change
being a non-trivial risk. [17] The Paris agreement, European Green deal and other initiatives
all proceed towards a sustainable future with negligible emissions and adverse effect through
operations on the climate. This brings about an opportunity for investors and companies
to design their organisations future towards a sustainable future, leading to better and safer
foundations as the deadline for initiatives get closer, and these investments will pave a way
through for financial viability. [2]
Blockchain technology and its adoption, not only works on easier methods for sustainability
goals due to its nature and operation, it can also work as a basis for generating protocols for
assuring sustainability among different organisations due to its transparency and traceability.
[18] To achieve this, an index fund smart contract can be used for different standards and sectors
of sustainability to automate investments based on carbon credit earned or exchanged, sustain-
ability growth and operations, and other factors that promote towards a sustainable net-zero
future. Moreover, upcoming blockchain use-cases for carbon credit authorization and verifica-
tion, with supply-chain operation tracking can shift the paradigm towards sustainable resources
to be employed by organisation, with blockchain technology paving the way to combating cli-
mate change. [6] This include sustainability reporting and assurance, handling and automating
carbon credit verification and earning through innovation, evaluating emissions through opera-
tions and maintenance via smart contracts, provide a ground for indexing of these specialized
blockchain for investor growth. [19]
