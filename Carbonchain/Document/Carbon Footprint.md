This paper examines blockchain operations based on the underlying algorithm, functionality, run-time requirements, resource requirements, and future scopes. The core method for examination includes evaluating and measuring carbon footprint and building plausible models using carbon credits to offset the damages. Hence, the paper aims to build indexing for companies for investment and social images by examining carbon footprint and carbon credit models and building a sustainable methodology for current and future blockchain organizations. Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed ledger shared among participating nodes for immutability, transparency, and high security. The operational requirements lead to high energy consumption for the core organization and the participating nodes, including the energy required for mining based on the consensus algorithm, network sharing, and storage requirements for processing and procuring the next steps. The energy consumption of the operations affects climate change leading to negative attention towards blockchain through public purview. Moreover, as a disruptive technology, its use cases are underway for decentralizing existing institutions while providing operational benefits to multiple existing models.
