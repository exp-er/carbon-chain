With its initial development in 2008, Blockchain has come a long way from a basic ledger system
for bitcoin cryptocurrency to the foundational technology for decentralizing institutions, trust-free applications, and immutable-transparent operations logging. However, its application requires strenuous
running of background procedures that keep the usefulness viable, ushering to multiple concerns about
its adverse effect on the climate. Emissions from blockchain technology have questioned its feasibility
and requirements. The carbon footprint for these operations is due to their run-time, requirements, functions/features, and future scope. Hence, paving the path through sustainability and feasibility requires a
proper understanding of how the operations affect the climate and how we can circumvent it. This paper
examines the effects of blockchain operations on sustainability and climate change, reverse engineering
algorithms under this technology, models for indexing companies using carbon footprint, characteristics
of blockchain organizations, and concepts of offsetting carbon footprint through credits. Carbon credits
or carbon offsets permit an organization to have a carbon footprint as long as it is essential for its operation. These can be bought or earned through various methods that help reduce carbon through tree
plantation, avoidance measures, or exchanges. Carbon indexes can work as incentives for investors to
invest in sustainable corporations; at the same time, they work as incentives for corporations to adopt
sustainable methodologies. In conclusion, the paper aims to develop a framework that corporations can
adopt to incorporate into their operations for a sustainable future.

        ## Contextual Background

This paper examines blockchain operations based on the underlying algorithm, functionality, run-time
requirements, resource requirements, and future scopes. The core method for examination includes evaluating and measuring the carbon footprint of different underlying technologies with plausible models for
evaluating carbon credits to offset emissions. Moreover, the paper aims to build indexing for corporations
created or based on Blockchain for investment. The index helps develop and maintain a social image by
examining corporations’ carbon footprint and carbon offset credit usage, providing incentives to build a
sustainable methodology for present and future operations.
1.1 Blockchain
Blockchain is a decentralised and distributed ledger shared among participating nodes for immutability,
transparency, and high security. Blockchain’s history can be traced back to Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency
developed through P2P technology supported by different levels of securities to make it tamper-proof.[55]
The technology allowed Bitcoin to provide freedom of payment, with user-defined fees, less risk, transparent transactions between all parties, absolute security, and decentralised management. However, the
operational requirements lead to increased energy consumption for the core organisation and the participating nodes, including the energy required for mining based on the consensus algorithm, network
sharing, and storage requirements for processing and procuring the next steps. Blockchain has come a
long way from supporting Bitcoin as a ledger. [65] Blockchain has use cases ranging from decentralising
institutions and corporations, supporting operations that require absolute trust to trust-free methods,
and modular technologies that provide better insights. Blockchain technology works on a P2P system run
by the users that support its computational requirements through mining. Hence, blockchain technology
is run by the people, for the people, and to the people, giving democracy a technological facet.
However, the energy consumption of the operations concerns climate change, and the computational
requirement for Blockchain leads to massive emissions in the form of electricity usage, leading to negative
attention towards Blockchain through public purview. Moreover, as a disruptive technology, its use cases
are underway for existing decentralising institutions while providing operational benefits to multiple
current models that question the feasibility of the trade-off between the help of the technology and its
adverse effects on the climate.[48]
1.2 Carbon Footprint
The total amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere by an individual/corporation’s operations. It is challenging to manage but important to calculate the carbon footprint production for all
activities, meagre or essential. Given the climate crisis, it is crucial to reform activities into more efficient
and sustainable alternatives. In this paper, we calculate carbon emissions throughout a corporation’s or
individual’s activities with the Blockchain. For that, we understand the underlying processes of different
blockchains and calculate emissions through each root element, averaging out the summation for the carbon footprint of a specific operation.[49] The value and understanding of the operations, objectives, and
1
1.3. CARBON CREDITS
requirements help us evaluate methods towards its reduction and innovation to shift to a more sustainable
approach.
The ”Carbon Footprint” concept came from the concept of ”Ecological Footprint” in the 1990s. As
carbon footprint deals with CO2 per year, ecological footprint deals with emissions compared to what
the planet can renew. It was popularised in 2005 by fossil fuel company BP when they ran an advertising
campaign for individuals to calculate their carbon footprint and reduce it. This campaign worked to
shift the blame of climate change and actions to individuals rather than corporations, but at the same
time worked great as awareness about each individual’s contribution to the climate crisis.[3] The concept
and requirements we are interested in starting with United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCC) in 1992. UNFCC is an international cooperation to combat climate change by adopting
sustainable methods and replacing methods that harm the climate. UNFCC has proposed actions such
as lowering emissions, achieving net-zero, innovations with alternate energies and carbon capture, and
carbon offset credits for incentivised net-zero goals.[15] Particularly Kyoto Protocol(1997/2005), Doha
Amendment(2012), and Paris Agreement (2015) involved countries in climate-centric actions to safeguard
the future. The Kyoto Protocol, discussed in 1997 and implemented in 2005, operationalises developed
countries to limit emissions as per the agreed terms through a document binding them with their promises
and penalties in case of failure. In the Doha Amendment(2012), additional actions were added to Kyoto
Protocol, with more countries added for climate-centric actions and reduced GHG emissions target from
5% to 18%. Paris Agreement(2015) improves on the concept and is volunteered by almost every country(195) to reduce GHG emissions with climate-centric actions for a sustainable future.[36] The Paris
Agreement(2015) is not legally binding and is on a volunteer basis by the countries, and each country has
presented their commitments depending on its situation. Moreover, the agreement incurs no penalties
for failure, giving countries some leeway to do things properly rather than haphazard actions that could
affect their development, with a single mindset of tackling the climate crisis.
The prominent effect of the climate crisis is increasing global temperature. The climate-centric actions
proposed through UNFCC aim to reduce that effect as much as possible. This framework significantly
impacts governments, policymakers, households, consumers, corporations, and investors. As such, this
framework brings about duty challenges, risks with actions, and opportunities for the future. Various
innovative methods are in development to tackle this framework and commitment efficiently. Natural
and Man-made methods are in development to make the change seamless.[56] In this paper, we examine
disruptive technology, its role in contributing towards emissions, how to make it efficient and sustainable,
and finally, what role it can play in tackling the emissions for itself and other industries.
The current standard for calculating carbon footprint is evaluating emissions through the supply chain
and employing organisations specifically for calculating the footprint, leading to an immense paper trail,
costs, and time-consuming procedures. Moreover, these calculations are on volunteer practices rather
than automated systems. Corporations share the objectives and the underlying operations they deem
appropriate with companies that excel in calculating the carbon footprint. These companies perform
fine-tuned calculations based on the operations and objectives of the corporations and produce a dashboard/report on their footprint. Hence, these footprints are the frame for perfection instead of being
closer to reality.[57] In this paper, we aim to design methodologies for automated carbon footprinting for
corporations based on Blockchain technology. Given its transparency benefit, the report thus generated
is accurate. We examine blockchain operations based on the underlying algorithm, functionality, runtime requirements, resource requirements, and future scopes. The core method for examination includes
evaluating and measuring carbon footprint and building plausible models to offset the damages. Hence,
evaluating companies’ contribution, responsibility, and social images by examining carbon footprint and
encouraging them to build a sustainable methodology for current and future blockchain operations. [59]
1.3 Carbon Credits
Due to frameworks discussed at UNFCCC with participating countries and pledges to take climate-centric
action towards a sustainable future, the reduction of emissions played a vital role, and it also led to the
development of another concept of Carbon neutrality or net-zero goals. The term is defined using carbon
emission standards. Positive carbon emission should equal negative carbon emission, leading to a netzero emission globally. The term can be traced back to Kyoto Protocol(1997) when signatories adopted
carbon offset credit using a cap-and-trade scheme by regulated authorities compared to being taxed for
carbon emissions. Corporations were allotted carbon credits per year based on their operations and had
to stay within that cap for their operations. If the corporation reached its ”cap”, it had to trade in more
2
1.4. CARBON INDEX
credits to stay under the limit. In the same way, if the corporation kept their emissions below the ”cap”,
they could trade the surplus credits with other corporations. [13]
The Paris Agreement(2015) banked on a similar concept to advocate carbon neutrality/ net-zero goals
for participating countries to offset carbon emissions and combat the climate crisis. COP26 at Glasgow
led to a turning point in using Carbon Credits as the negotiators requested and approved a voluntary
market for carbon credits. Hence, carbon credits are exchanged through a regulatory market between
governments and corporations and a voluntary market through an organisation or individuals that use
multiple methods to create more carbon credits by offsetting their carbon footprint. [42]
Various methods for creating or attaining carbon credits have come under purview. Carbon credits can
be developed by investing in renewable energy, improving efficiency, capturing carbon, returning biomass
to the soil, promoting forest growth, and switching to alternative fuel types. Various technologies are
developing to analyse carbon footprint and calculate the number of carbon credits required for offset.
Organisations that solely focus on creating carbon credits to trade with individuals and corporations.[53]
The slow evolution of carbon markets between individuals and corporations provides financial incentives
for sustainability.
The opportunities that carbon credits bring out as an investment for the future assist developing
countries with the time and resources to provide incentives for sustainable methods while conforming to
the agreement to deal with climate change. The current form of carbon credit is through a voluntary
emission reduction market or a regulatory framework for offsetting emissions from a project. However,
blockchain technology can provide an edge to the work of carbon credits to be more fair and decentralised
with automated functionality for transparent transfer and emission calculation. Cryptocurrency in the
form of tokens or coins could work as the currency for carbon credit exchanges. The trust-free and
transparent benefit of Blockchain could give carbon credits the necessary boost for a fair market where
corporations participate in creating carbon credits through multiple means rather than focusing on buying
the offset.[37] The technology can also help calculate carbon footprint accurately through the project’s
lifecycle, and better metrics will lead to better evaluation and profits.
In this paper, we evaluate carbon footprints for the underlying working of a Blockchain-based corporation and how it could be made sustainable and efficient given its feasibility. Moreover, based on our
evaluation, we include carbon credits in the structure to make the operation carbon neutral.
1.4 Carbon Index
To deal with the entire lifecycle of a sustainable future, with government policies that are regulated and
amended for climate-centric actions through agreements at UNFCC. Corporations are working towards
a net-zero lifecycle due to corporate social responsibilities and government regulations. Individuals are
taking the initiative to offset their carbon emissions and create methods to earn carbon credits to support
carbon markets. Finally, the subsequent step would be incentives for corporations to offset their carbons
rather than just compulsory offsets mandated by the government. Even though regulatory carbon credits
allow trading, the government fixed prices based on the fossil fuel, the project’s requirement and net-zero
goals. Hence, we propose another incentive through carbon indexes.
With the evaluation of carbon footprint and the existence of carbon credits, this paper develops
carbon-based indexing for Blockchain-based corporations or corporations employing Blockchain as their
means of operation for core functionalities. These indexes incentives the corporation to shift towards
a more sustainable approach. Startups can build better methods using alternative energies and create
carbon credits or provide alternative methods of operations that conform to carbon neutrality norms.
Individuals can invest in corporations that perform climate-centric, reducing their carbon emissions rather
than just offsetting them through sheer profits. The indexing developed on the correlation between the
existing carbon footprint with the organisation’s carbon credit and sustainability rating. [31] Hence,
giving an edge to sustainable companies based on carbon footprints compared to unsustainable ones.

        This paper aims to evaluate the carbon footprint of Blockchain Technology and incorporate them for
designing frameworks that can aid towards a climate-centric action alongside carbon offset credits and
carbon indexes. For evaluation, we reverse engineer the operational requirements of blockchain applications and test individual elements for carbon footprint by researching data and using formulae with
the latest metrics through API(s). As the carbon footprint is generated and added, carbon neutrality is
calculated through carbon prices and offset prices required based on emissions which are later utilised for
developing the carbon index. The underlying functions are developed through Python and combined as
a public-use software application.
2.1 Blockchain
Blockchain is a decentralised and distributed ledger that records transactions across many computers.
The technology creates an immutable, transparent, and secure system for recording data. Technically, it
is a structure or block that contains information(usually transaction details) connected with a previous
block(unless Genesis block), and the entire block is encrypted using cryptographic functions. Hence,
all the blocks in the blockchain are linearly connected through cryptographic hashes. We evaluate the
carbon footprint of blockchain by understanding and evaluating the operational algorithms that make
blockchain work. [35]
2.1.1 Consensus Algorithm
Blockchain is decentralised, and it’s recorded across multiple nodes/participants. For any block to be
added to Blockchain, all the nodes must reach a consensus regarding the block, when approved, leads
to adding another block to the blockchain. The underlying consensus algorithm and its procedure differ
among existing blockchains.
Proof of Work(PoW)
Proof of Work(PoW) is a consensus algorithm in which nodes act as miners that share computational
power to solve a mathematical puzzle in order to create a new block and add it to the blockchain. The
first miner to solve the puzzle gets rewarded with cryptocurrency for their effort. This algorithm is
considered highly secure due to great difficulty and is mostly decentralised. However, it has high energy
consumption due to computational requirements from the nodes.[28] PoW has been utilised to develop
algorithms like Proof of Burn, Proof of Capacity, and more.
Proof of Stake(PoS)
Proof of Stake(PoS) is a consensus algorithm in which participants stake a certain amount of the
cryptocurrency to reach a consensus and create a new block to add to the blockchain. Once the consensus
among 51% of the entire stake is reached, the block is added. It is comparatively efficient to PoW.
However, for newer blockchains, it is easy to compromise by taking control of more than 51% of the
sake.[62] This is difficult and unlikely when considering Ethereum(ETH) or Cardano(ADA) that have
higher values per coin or high volumes. PoS has been utilised to develop Delegated Proof of Stake(DPoS), Liquid Proof of Stake(LPoS), Bonded Proof of Stake(BPoS), and more.
Proof of Elapsed Time(PoET) Proof of Elapsed Time(PoET) is a consensus algorithm in which
4
2.1. BLOCKCHAIN
participants join the blockchain by membership, and for every block, they are randomly assigned a waiting
time. The waiting time corresponds to how much the miner has to wait before they can start mining
the block. [29] Hence, the participant allotted the lowest waiting time gets to mine the next block on
the blockchain. The allotment of the waiting time is random. Hence, this consensus algorithm is also
considered the fairest consensus algorithm.
Byzantine Fault Tolerance(BFT) Byzantine Fault Tolerance(BFT) is a consensus algorithm that
specialises in the consensus part more than the algorithm. In this, the participants vote to reach a
consensus regarding the block being added to the blockchain. Once the network has a 2/3rd consensus,
the block is added automatically. It is implemented for situations when participants give false information
or are not performing. Even though BFT has scaling issues and is vulnerable to Sybil attack, the
algorithm can easily be combined with other consensus algorithms to rectify the shortcomings.[54] BFT
has been utilised to develop Federated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (FBFT), Delegated Byzantine Fault
Tolerance(DBFT), and more.
Blockchain technology incorporates many consensus algorithms based on use cases and requirements.
However, we are interested in the technology’s carbon footprint rather than the different amendments to
the consensus algorithm. We want to discuss the aforementioned consensus algorithms for the project,
as other algorithms have different underlying choice mechanisms. However, they broadly work on similar
structures corresponding to the carbon footprint.
2.1.2 Mining Algorithm
Blockchain is considered an energy-hungry technology due to the Proof of Work and mining requirements
to keep such blockchains operating. However, the underlying algorithm for mining the next block differs among blockchains. Proof of Work has an underlying mining algorithm that specifies the required
mathematical puzzle to solve in order to mine the next block. The mining algorithm varies with solution
methods for puzzles, incorporating different methods for improved efficiency for lower emission or faster
transactions, and may include special benefits based on the blockchain.
SHA-256 SHA-256 is the most used mining algorithm as it is used for mining Bitcoin. The mining
algorithm is also simple. It contains functions to convert strings to a hash, includes a date-time stamp for
the blocks to be sequential, incorporates a hash of the previous block for improved security, and finally,
a nonce that defines the difficulty of the mathematical puzzle.[59] In this mining algorithm, the nonce is
defined as the number of zeroes that should exist at the beginning of the hash. As the nonce increases,
finding the perfect hash for the next block is difficult before it can be added to the blockchain.
Ethash Ethereum developers designed Ethash, hence the name, using an improved and extended
version of DAG. Previously known as the Dagger-Hashimoto algorithm, it relies on the SHA-3 function
with a version of Dagger-Hashimoto hashes. Ethash requires a high amount of memory to choose subsets
of a fixed resource dependent on the nonce and block header. The resource is changed every 30000 blocks.
A seed is computed for each block in history using block headers to generate a cache. [7] The cache can
generate a massive dataset, only using a small number of items from the cache. Mining uses memory to
compute the dataset by slicing the cache and rebuilding it.
Scrypt Scrypt was developed as an algorithm for cryptographically protecting online services that
keep backups. In this algorithm, the options are artificially complicated by adding noise. The noise is
used to increase the work time, and are randomly generated numbers added to the possible solutions.
The mining is done by generating random numbers and storing them in the RAM of the processor, which
is accessed continuously for checking and then submitted on success to mine the next block.[18] Scrypt
is deemed the most complete cryptographic mining algorithm.
Equilhash Equilhash uses a complex mathematical problem known as the ”Birthday Problem” for
mining. It has high memory requirements through RAM. Higher RAM can easily solve the mathematical
problem leaving the block to be mined easily.[21] In comparison, lower RAM would increase the complexity
and time required to solve the mathematical problem avoiding the centralisation of mining by ASIC
hardware(low RAM).
CryptoNight Cryptonight was designed as an efficient solution for untraceable transactions on the
blockchain using ring signatures and stealth addresses.[6] Cryptonight includes a loop for the solution,
where memory write operations and subsequent read operations occur repeatedly. This loop determines
5
2.2. CARBON FOOTPRINT
which hash function to use for producing block solution output. CryptoNight is extremely sensitive to
memory latency and is supposed to work on the same size working data as shared cache memories in
modern CPUs. [11]
2.1.3 Use Cases
Blockchain technology, though mainly used in cryptocurrencies in the past, has been evolving into a disruptive technology that is improving operations in many sectors. In contrast, technologies that primarily
use blockchain as their underlying technology are easier to calculate the carbon footprint. The paper
aims to provide frameworks for technologies incorporating blockchain technology to replace traditional
operations with blockchain operations. The carbon footprint for such sectors requires additional factors
to be computed.
Supply Chain A corporation’s supply chain is a core functionality for many consumer-good-based
sectors. The fast fashion industry has a massive supply chain, from procuring raw materials to manufacturing locations to delivering goods to retailers. Similarly, the food industry has import-export of raw
materials all over the globe, procurement of raw materials, processing, packaging and then delivery to
restaurants and groceries. Even fossil-fuel industries that export oil and other fuels to different manufacturing factories for continued production have supply chain management.[51] Blockchain technology
solves a few issues for supply-chain. It helps reduce the lengthy paper trail of supply-chain to ledger alternatives that can be updated in real-time and verified as it happens rather than at checkpoints. Moreover,
as each event of a supply chain is recorded, it gets easier to calculate emissions of the entire operation
by calculating the carbon footprint of each step and then combining it with the internal emissions of the
corporation for an accurate estimate.[14] For our project, we consider different carbon calculations for
estimating the footprint through the supply chain.
Decentralized Exchange Decentralised Exchanges is one the most popular application of Blockchain
technology. It is considered an improvement on centralised exchange platforms for cryptocurrencies by
incorporating a smart contract. A smart contract automatically executes on the blockchain once the
condition mentioned in the smart contract are met.[47] Through this, the decentralized exchange platforms
are middlemen with no involvement except pipe-lining the exchange. The user has full control over their
assets, and the transactions are accurate and real-time. The shortcomings of a decentralised exchange
are due to gas fees applied to every transaction, and depending on the blockchain used, transaction time
varies between really fast to slow. The carbon footprint of such applications is generally dependent on
the underlying blockchain and the emission per transaction.[50]
NFT Non-Fungible Tokens(NFT) are an application of blockchain through which we create tokenised
assets. These assets could be physical or virtual, including property leases, legal contracts, art, music,
videos, etc. [38] NFT promote anti-counterfeiting, provenance tracking and title transfer. As an underlying application of blockchain and due to massive popularity, NFTs were among the first to come
under scrutiny regarding climate crisis and emissions. As such, we consider the impact of NFT given the
blockchain, token type, and number of NFTs minted. [4]
Securing Personal Information/Identities Decentralised Identity Verification is an optimistic
application of Blockchain technology where users can store their identity on a blockchain and use that
for verification in multiple blockchain applications and operations. Decentralised Identity would promote
the identity to be stored in a highly secure and scalable blockchain and be accessed through different
applications for verification, this will protect the identity from being stored in multiple places, and
leakage from any one of them could compromise the identity. [1] Moreover, it will make the identity
process efficient for future applications revolving around authorising identities for control flow. The idea
for calculating footprint for such a use-case is to consider identity variables stored as blocks rather than
multiple transactions making up a blockchain. Each identity variable could make up a part of the block,
making it easier to share some information when requests are made rather than sharing the entire identity
information. [17]
2.2 Carbon Footprint
The carbon footprint of any process is calculating the respective emissions of CO2 during each step of the
process during its lifecycle and the collective value of carbon emission. Since the Paris Agreement (2015),
6
2.3. CARBON CREDIT
governments have pledged to tackle the climate crisis by reducing their carbon emission to reasonable
values in the coming years. This has led to massive development for calculating carbon footprint, efficient
alternatives, offsetting strategies, and responsibility factor. For this project, we consider carbon footprint
through blockchain technologies.[23] These include individuals or corporations working on blockchain
and individuals or corporations that have inculcated blockchain technology for some operations due to
its benefits and feasibility.
Carbon Footprint can be broadly categorised into three types
2.2.1 Direct
Direct carbon footprint is how CO2 is emitted directly from our operations. For the scope of the project,
it would be through mining algorithms and the computational requirements, if the corporation is built
on blockchain, emissions due to validations and voting methods for other consensus algorithms like PoS
or BFT, and finally the amount of time the nodes have to remain active on the blockchain.[30] In this
project, we calculate the direct emissions through provided values, taking average power consumptions
of the device and running simulations of underlying algorithms, with using API to gather global metrics
for average footprint for the blockchain as a whole, and for each participating node.
2.2.2 Indirect
Indirect carbon footprint is how CO2 is emitted indirectly and separate from our operations. It could be
the emissions that occurred due to the manufacturing of components we employ for our operations, the
emissions of the services we are using to stay connected, the emission cost of running servers to maintain
uptime of our application, and so on. These footprints are usually not clear and aren’t calculated efficiently
for multiple reasons. Primarily, if all corporations or individuals calculate their own carbon footprint for
their processes, all indirect carbon footprint would also be included. However, it is difficult to bring
that change unless proposed or enforced by the government or sustainability mindsets.[5] For this, we are
unable to provide exact metrics for due to lack of information regarding all the indirect participants for
any specific application. We do multiple it by a simple factor for close to realistic values.
2.2.3 External
External footprints are similar to indirect carbon footprint but are essential to the processes. Example, the
amount of electricity consumed for running a mining algorithm for a few hours can be calculated through
hash rate/time spent/power consumption, etc. However, the emissions for the miner and his consumption
to keep the hardware running optimally through external or internal cooling, power consumption by
displays and other devices for interactions with the system, etc., are external to the core processes
and usually ignored as their contribution to the emission is negligible compared to direct emissions.[20]
However, considering that the emissions are negligible for an individual, when expanded to the number
of nodes in a typical mining environment, the negligible amount become substantial. External footprints
are difficult to manage as they are unforeseen in most processes. However, we assume simple factors
based on average values for a better estimate.
2.3 Carbon Credit
Carbon credit or carbon offsets credits are permits provided to organisations for carbon emissions during their project lifecycle. Carbon credits were incorporated after the Kyoto Protocol (1997) through
regulatory carbon market through a cap-and-trade scheme. Governments provided a cap to organisation with carbon credits corresponding to that cap. The organisation and its projects had to remain
under the cap corresponding to carbon emissions. In case, the emissions were lesser than the cap, the
organisation could trade the surplus carbon credits for monetary benefits. Similarly, if the organisation
was unable to stay under the cap, they had to trade extra carbon credits at a price to stay under the
new cap and essentially stay carbon-neutral by reaching net-zero emissions. [27] In November 2021,
during the COP26 at Glasgow, governments agreed with the negotiators for a voluntary carbon market
for individuals and organisations that do not correspond to regulatory carbon markets. This marked
the advent of scalable carbon markets for the future. In this project, we discuss how these credits are
verified and distributed, how are the offsets calculated and applied, and a contract for its application on
the blockchain in combination with carbon footprint. [19]
7
2.4. CARBON INDEX
2.3.1 Verification
A carbon credit lifecycle includes a project ideation and its procedures, boundaries and requirements.
Emissions are calculated and reduced appropriately throughout the project and the calculated amount is
submitted to verified authorities to award carbon credits based on the project and the amount of emissions
reduced. The carbon credits awarded can be purchased by individuals, organisations and corporations at
voluntary markets to be sold later for profits. [39]The profit can then be used for funding new projects
with its ideation, procedures, boundaries, and requirements and hence the process continues. There are
multiple ways to verify carbon credits, one is through reducing emissions as mentioned before. Others
include projects that specifically aim to earn carbon credits to climate-centric activities like reforestation,
carbon capture, alternative energy methods and practices, etc. [44]These projects can directly calculate
the carbon reduced or activities that will reduce carbon in the future and earn carbon credits. The
verification and awarding of carbon credits is through legitimate authorities like Gold Standard, Verra,
American Carbon Registry, Climate Action Reserve, Verified Carbon Standard, etc. More voluntary
organisations are trying to understand the verification model and create efficient methods to be authorised
and become legitimate verification organisation for carbon credits.
2.3.2 Offset
The history of offset can be traced back to net-zero emissions. Net-zero emissions state that if the
positive carbon emission is equal to the negative carbon emissions, we will have a balance in carbon
emissions in the atmosphere. Hence, stagnating the climate crisis giving human beings more time to
improvise methods that are less intensive to the environment and slowly heal the damage we have done.
Offsets are the negative carbon emission that work through reduction of expected carbon emissions in
a project, through applications and innovations that directly reduce carbon from the environment, or
through improving or supporting natural methods of carbon capture and carbon cycle. [2]
For our project, the offset play a vital role when dealing with blockchain to calculate the amount
required per participating node and assists in developing smart contracts that could offset automatically
as the transaction is processed.
2.4 Carbon Index
Climate crisis, carbon markets, and sustainability goals provide incentives for developing towards more
sustainable procedures for projects and developing carbon credit applications and processes to maximise
profits in the upcoming carbon market. However, to improve the incentives drastically, by involving not
just the projects that reduce the expected emissions or projects that aim to capture and reduce carbon
from the environment, we propose an investment fund index corresponding to carbon.
Investments are essential to gather funds for a project or an organisation to support the initial development and gather the necessary components before the project can be completed and profits can be
generated accordingly. Hence, designing a carbon index for investment where the benchmark for inclusion
is based on carbon reduction practises or climate-centric activities would provide incentives for companies
to proceed towards improving or inculcating carbon reduction practices on their agenda. [34]
2.4.1 Calculation
Index funds are based on benchmarking of all companies based on specified criteria. It could be around
technology, precious metals, financial rankings, etc. The calculation for the benchmarks are based on
historical data around the requirement and are volatile based on the stock market. The benchmarking
remains constant however the included stocks could change depending on the performance based on the
criteria. Hence, in regards with carbon index, the benchmarking can be calculated through their carbon
footprint, carbon emission reduction, and carbon offsets bought or generated. [58] All these factors could
be used separately for specialised indexes and combined to form a complete model for the future.
2.4.2 Footprint
Carbon Index benchmarking using carbon footprint is fairly simple, a historical data of carbon emissions
for an organisation is taken and plotted to watch the trend, if the trend is positive such that the carbon
emissions is increasing over time, the organisation is scored worse. In contrast, if the trend is negative,
the organisation is scored better.[22]The percentage of how much the trend varies can determine the
8
2.4. CARBON INDEX
ranking of organisation. Moreover, it is feasible to consider the underlying technologies and operations
for an organisation to improve the benchmark and make it optimal for multiple companies.[64]
2.4.3 Credit
Another way for carbon index benchmarking is through carbon offset credits. For organisations in regulatory carbon market, the cap-and-trade stats could be used as the benchmark, if an organisation trades
out carbon offset credits, then they are rated better. In contrast, if organisations trade-in credits, they
are rated worse. For voluntary carbon markets, it is viable to rate organisations who voluntarily buy
offsets to be rated better compared to organisations that have emissions but aren’t regulated and don’t
participate in offsetting their emissions through carbon credits. Moreover, using ratio of carbon emissions
to carbon credits in the benchmark would be feasible to promote a fair market. [32]

        This paper attempts to design a framework using the carbon footprint, credit and index around blockchain
technology. Blockchain technology has always fascinated me with its features exquisitely supporting trustfree and immutable ledger systems, which users support by sharing computational power to solve complex
mining algorithms for block generation. However, the initial hype of Blockchain technology has slowly
stabilised due to multiple regulations on mining, alternative methods, and fraud/crashes of multiple
Blockchain corporations. The climate crisis is the buzzword for discussion in almost every sector, with
mandatory action required to safeguard our future through climate-centric actions added to everyone’s
agenda. At the same time, challenges come with greater opportunities. In November 2021, governments
allowed the trade of carbon credits for individuals and organisations, leading to the advent of carbon
markets in the future. Investments are outlined with sustainability and innovations for climate-centric
technology in mind. All these events collapse together for an opportunity to build a framework that can
be adopted by individuals, organisations and corporations to start their journey or to replace existing
operations with sustainable and mindfully profitable alternatives. [60]
Presently, multiple innovations involving green technology are being developed in the Blockchain sector
with net-zero mining Blockchain and improvements in consensus algorithms for efficiency and stability.
Carbon offset credit has been on the news with multiple partnerships between startups or corporations
with verification authorities to participate in voluntary carbon markets. The first stage of the Paris
Agreement and for countries to honour their pledges is less than a decade away, leading to ramping up
policy amendments and changes to meet the emission requirements.[12] Investments are outlined with
sustainability and innovations for climate-centric technology in mind.
For this framework, our primary component is a carbon footprint. We calculate the approximate emissions produced by the operational requirements of blockchain applications through its consensus algorithm, mining algorithm used, hash rate, average power consumption, gas-free relations, and use-case
dependencies. The carbon footprint helps us develop specialized pooling rules and smart contract designs
that could support and automate carbon-neutral actions. We can automate carbon-neutral actions by
using carbon offset credit tokens that can be deducted or attained directly through a verified provider,
i.e., a portion of profits for every node will automatically be used to purchase carbon offset credits, making it carbon-neutral. The smart contract applies to blockchain corporations and users participating for
profits or to support a disruptive technology. While carbon offset credits are not a long-term solution,
they offer some incentives for adopting sustainable processes. As the final part of the framework, we
introduce the carbon index. The carbon index works similarly to any index fund, a portfolio based on
carbon footprint, credit, and ratios. It provides incentives for corporations to adopt sustainable methods,
improve their carbon rating and, when combined with their ESG ratings, be supported more through the
financial stock markets in the future.

This paper aims to design a framework incorporating the carbon footprint, carbon credits, and carbon index around blockchain technology. The research methodology is divided into quantitative and qualitative
analysis of blockchain technologies. For carbon footprint, We evaluate various blockchain technologies
by using real-time metrics of their operations and calculating the power consumption through each node,
these are then processed with government estimates regarding the relation between power consumption
to carbon emission, giving us an estimate of the footprint. Moreover, we run the underlying algorithms
of the blockchain technologies and calculate the time required for basic implementation and compute
trends in the future as they are designed to increasing difficulty. Moreover, we consider the qualitative analysis by researching trends around the blockchain technology and adoption rate of sustainable
methods in the sector.[26] For analysing and evaluating, we consider the underlying technologies of a
blockchain and evaluate them individually based on different metrics provided or run by the system to
calculate emissions. Estimate values are taken for the calculation that can be changed depending on
different scenarios. In the project, we evaluate the direct footprint through consensus algorithm of the
blockchain, the mining algorithm for hashing and block generation, the validators and stake participation,
idle waiting time of the system, and use-cases that consider external or indirect carbon footprint. For
carbon credits, the qualitative analysis is done through researching trends around the blockchain technology sector, adoption rate of blockchain companies and sustainability culture, node participation and
efficiency methods around offsetting emissions, etc. The quantitative analysis of carbon credit is through
simple calculation in relation with metrics generated through carbon footprint analysis and presented
based on offset carbon required for net-zero emissions. Carbon index benchmark are generated through
the results obtained through carbon footprint and carbon credit analyses and incorporated using different
criteria’s for developing multiple benchmarks that can be utilised individually. The research methodology is in accordance with the recent trends regarding climate-centric actions and sustainable development
goals. Carbon emission reduction is a major agenda for sustainable development and reaching carbon
neutrality around the world. Carbon footprint evaluation for industries should become mandatory across
all sectors for accurate estimates of the emissions. Carbon credits should be automatically verified and
awarded based on conduct and practices through technology for efficient processing. Index funds that are
benchmarked on the basis of carbon provide incentives for corporations to adopt sustainable practices
quickly.

6.1 Project Overview
This paper aims to evaluate and design a framework for the carbon footprint, carbon credit, and carbon
index around blockchain technology. The project design aims to incorporate the different evaluations for
underlying technologies in blockchain regarding the carbon footprint by using the power consumption,
network hash rates, time spent on the process, and standards estimated by the government. The project
incorporates all types of carbon footprint, I.e., direct, indirect and external carbon footprint. For evaluation purposes, we analyse consensus algorithm that is used in the blockchain between the nodes to reach
a consensus before creating and adding a block to the blockchain.[40] We analyse the mining algorithms
that is used to create the blocks and the technology used for hashing the transactions for the block
that are incorporated according to the consensus algorithm for blockchain technology. We also analyse
the real-time data of cryptocurrencies to calculate their carbon footprint and offsets based on simple
calculations through standardised estimates from the government and incorporate similar calculations
for including user-based calculations of carbon footprint for that cryptocurrency. Moreover, we include
use-cases based evaluation of blockchain technologies to understand the indirect and external factors that
could increase/contribute towards the overall emissions of a project using blockchain technologies.
The offsets are calculated through evaluating emissions with the standards for offsetting cost per CO2
emission. The offsets are generalised for all algorithms as more research is required for incorporating
fine-tuned offsetting strategies when dealing with blockchain technology. An amendment to ESG rating
is proposed using carbon footprint and offset data for better analysis and social image of cryptocurrencies.
Smart contract design frameworks are generated for both carbon footprint and credits in form of specialised functions that can be added to contracts to achieve carbon neutrality/ net-zero emissions through
automatic offsetting of the carbon emissions using updated gwei or automatically taxed cryptocurrency
on exchange.
The carbon index benchmark is generated by collecting evaluation results of carbon footprint and
carbon credits and incorporating them based on ranking by using trends and moving averages.
6.2 Carbon Footprint
Carbon footprint can be defined as the total measure of emissions that has an adverse effect on the
climate. Carbon footprint is calculated throughout the lifecycle of an individual’s day, organisation’s
project, operations, etc. For our project, we calculate the carbon footprint around blockchain technologies.
Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that supported Bitcoin cryptocurrency in the beginning.
Now, it is also considered a disruptive technology that aims to decentralize various sectors into automated
entities given its trust-free, secure, immutable, and transparent features. For our project we consider
some underlying factors that can contribute towards the carbon footprint and evaluate the emissions
accordingly.
6.2.1 Cryptocurrency
For calculations of carbon footprint of cryptocurrency, we used API to request real-time data regarding
the cryptocurrency and then used those values to calculate estimated carbon footprint emissions. In
13
6.2. CARBON FOOTPRINT
this section of the project, we did avoid Fiat currencies and only considered Cryptocurrency coins and
tokens. We evaluated Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ethereum PoW, Ethereum Classic, XRP, Doge, Cardano and
Polygon. All these cryptocurrencies are popular and usually fall under the top 15 or are related to the top
currencies, e.g., Ethereum PoW and Ethereum Classic. All PoW currency metrics were attained through
minerstat, which was also used to run mining to calculate average power consumption of the system.
While PoS and BFT similar cryptocurrencies were calculated by researching their power consumption
and then using number of transactions to calculate power consumption per transaction and use that with
government standards for carbon emissions to evaluate the carbon footprint and the offset required for
net-zero emissions.
6.2.2 Consensus Algorithm
For calculations of carbon footprint of Consensus Algorithm, we used popular consensus algorithms that
differ in core functionality and used their operations to calculate estimated footprint emissions. In this
section of the project, we did avoid consensus algorithm that were based on popular consensus algorithm
due to time constraints and similar functionalities leading to similar carbon footprints estimation. We
evaluated Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, Byzantine Fault Tolerance, and Proof of Elapsed Time. All
these consensus algorithms are popular and is used and improved upon to generate multiple consensus
algorithms. We used the core functionality of each consensus algorithm to evaluate the carbon footprint.
In case of Proof of Work, we used the mining hash rate, power consumption and time elapsed as the
major criteria. For Proof of Stake, we used the overall power consumption with the stakes of a person
to evaluate percentage effort for transaction verification and evaluated the carbon footprint. Byzantine
fault tolerance was operated similarly to Proof of Stake; however, we include a simple verification for
validation and then using the count of validators specify individual carbon footprint. Finally, for Proof of
Elapsed time, we used average idle time of the miners and the time required to mine a block to evaluate
the carbon footprint. [61]

6.2.3 Mining Algorithm
For calculations of carbon footprint of Mining Algorithm, we evaluated the most-used hash mining algorithms that are popular in the mining industry.[10] We simulated a simplified version of the mining
algorithm run in a loop of increasing difficulty with time taken and average power consumption of the
system to calculate carbon footprint.[8] As the difficult increases, the time taken increases and hence
the carbon emissions for mining. In this section of the project, we used SHA-256 which is the algorithm behind Bitcoin, Ethash which used to support Ethereum before the merger but still supports other
cryptocurrencies, we used Scrypt that is considered the most cryptographically complete algorithm that
supports Litecoin and Dogecoin, we also evaluated Equilhash, that is the most mathematically complex
and CryptoNight, that promotes unbeatable anonymity for transactions. All mining algorithms were
evaluated based on increasing difficulty and time taken with average power consumption. [46]

6.2.4 Use-case
For calculations of carbon footprint of Use cases, we evaluated popular blockchain applications that are
in-use right now or are being incorporated with blockchain technologies to improve the operations. We
assumed certain characteristics of the use cases through qualitative analysis and used them for evaluating
carbon footprint using government standards. The use cases we evaluated in our project are Supply
Chain, Non-Fungible Tokens, Decentralized Exchanges, and Secure information. [43] Among these, NonFungible Tokens and Decentralized Exchanges are already incorporated with blockchain technology and
were evaluated based on current standards. While Supply chain technology and Secure Information using
blockchain technology was evaluated through assumptions and government standards and estimates.
6.2.5 Smart Contract Design
The smart contract design was based on a simple function that can be added to the solidity code and
be used to add carbon footprint evaluation onto the contract which can be executed automatically once
the smart contract is being processed. The function is dependent on the blockchain it is based on, for
our project, we stuck to Ethereum and depending on the transactions it requires, the function calculates
the offset price. It can be automatically added on with the gas prices or separately depending on the
blockchain and other functions of the smart contract.
6.3 Carbon Credit
Carbon credit or carbon offsets credits are permits provided to organisations for carbon emissions during
their project lifecycle. Carbon credits were incorporated after the Kyoto Protocol (1997) through regulatory carbon market through a cap-and-trade scheme. In November 2021, during the COP26 at Glasgow,
16
6.4. CARBON INDEX
governments agreed with the negotiators for a voluntary carbon market for individuals and organisations
that do not correspond to regulatory carbon markets.[52] This marked the advent of scalable carbon
markets for the future. In this project, we discuss how these credits are verified and distributed, how are
the offsets calculated and applied, and a contract for its application on the blockchain in combination
with carbon footprint. [25]
6.3.1 Offset calculations
Offset calculations for the project were done at the same time as the footprint was evaluated for each
carbon footprint evaluation method. The offset calculations are based on the standard estimations of
carbon offset credits and the use-case, for our project, we use tech-based carbon offsets and calculated
that by multiplying the carbon footprint with the standard metric. [33]
6.3.2 Offset Contract Design
The offset smart contract design is like that of carbon footprint, and amends that with the functionality
of calculating offsets based on different blockchains you have used and their comparative technologies, so
if a blockchain is using sustainable methods, you gain offsets over the carbon footprint cost and offset
cost. [45]
6.4 Carbon Index
Investments are essential to gather funds for a project or an organisation to support the initial development and gather the necessary components before the project can be completed and profits can be
generated accordingly. Hence, designing a carbon index for investment where the benchmark for inclusion
is based on carbon reduction practises or climate-centric activities would provide incentives for companies
to proceed towards improving or inculcating carbon reduction practices on their agenda.
6.4.1 Benchmark calculation
For our project, we designed an approach for carbon footprint to carbon Index benchmarking using
historical data of carbon emissions for an organisation is taken and plotted to watch the trend and
moving averages. The benchmarking approach also includes use-case specification as some use cases have
higher indirect and external footprint, compared to internal carbon footprint. Another benchmarking
approach includes the usage of carbon credits, like that of carbon footprint and can be used using historical
data of carbon offsets for an organisation and plotting to watch the trend and moving average. Finally,
a benchmarking approach where the carbon footprint trend and carbon offset trend are compared and
ranking is generated accordingly.[24]
6.5 Project Execution
The project is executed through a webApp by using streamlit library to map the python functionality
on the web interactively. The webApp is divided into multiple parts based on their role and usage. The
home button gives an overview of the project, its aim and objectives. The Project button implements
the aforementioned project execution, explaining each sections with interactive code displaying power
consumption, time taken, carbon emission, offset cost for all the factors undertaken for evaluation. Moreover, it also contains user-based inputs for calculating users footprint depending on their activities on the
blockchain specifying to the evaluation method. The Document button implements all the text from the
research and more incorporated through radio buttons for access with the entire list of references to be
viewed in Harvard style. Finally, the contact button includes feedback for the project and includes the
github repository link and email id for further contact.

After properly executing the project, we analysed the results of our findings and the patterns generated
regarding the carbon footprint, carbon credit and carbon index in blockchain technology.
Our main objectives for the project were to measure and evaluate carbon emissions due to consensus
algorithms, mining algorithms and use cases. The consensus algorithm broadly evaluates the emissions
without evaluating the underlying mining algorithms that could be efficient, which can be rectified by
incorporating the evaluation of consensus and mining algorithm together. Moreover, the emissions are
extreme for the consensus algorithm PoW compared to another consensus algorithm. However, it is
arguable about the trade-off between security and efficiency between these algorithms promotes PoW,
albeit with sustainable approaches in the future. While mining algorithms were tested for the time taken
and difficulty in plotting graphs regarding the time taken and average power consumption leading to
higher emissions in the future, the actual technology of the mining algorithm was difficult to simulate
due to hardware and time limitations. In our project, we had to simplify the mining algorithm to
the underlying mathematical problem and evaluate that using a loop for increasing difficulty with the
time taken. Even though the results do simulate and are like real-world measures, the proper mining
algorithms used for cryptocurrencies could be more efficient or less efficient depending on the use-case,
e.g., we use CryptoNight mining algorithm that uses slow and fast hash and compared the time is
taken which simulates the hashing algorithm with increasing difficulty based on byte-phrase. However,
CryptoNight has been deemed the most anonymous mining algorithm, which took a lot of work to
simulate and could lead to lower efficiency when using cryptocurrencies based on CryptoNight. Usecase evaluation for carbon footprint was based on estimates rather than reality in most cases, which
can be improved upon as those use cases are readily developed using blockchain, and the operations are
clear for evaluation.[16] We also found that some use cases that have an adverse effect on the climate
don’t play a major role, such as NFT. Due to its popularity, NFT was considered to be affecting the
climate due to the huge number of transactions being done on the NFT marketplace. However, after
qualitative analysis, NFTs are just smart contracts sent on the mining operations for verification. The
mining operations are running perpetually, so NFTs have negligible addition regarding promoting direct
emissions. But, indirectly, the popularity of NFT did contribute to the popularity of cryptocurrencies
leading to more mining operations at a higher frequency. We incorporated real-time cryptocurrency data
through APIs for calculating overall emissions estimates. The calculation was done through mining on
pooling software to calculate the system’s average power consumption per hour and then incorporate
the readings into the formula. We also questioned sustainable operations for different use cases already
incorporated in blockchain technology or could be incorporated into blockchain technology for sustainable
development and lower emissions. Evaluated the role of participant nodes on the emissions based on hash
rate, power consumption, and time spent for PoW. For PoS and similar algorithms, we evaluated the
emissions based on stakes and validator verification to define the percentage effort on participation in
the overall emissions of the technology. A framework was designed to incorporate carbon credits into the
blockchain using smart contract designs, including the emissions that occur during the operations.[41]
Finally, using the methods, we formalised carbon index benchmarking methods that can be operated by
collecting real-time data and appending it to calculate trends and moving averages for ranking.

estimate carbon emissions which could be improved upon with more time and processing power. The
carbon footprint metrics attained and the metrics that caused issues correspond to transparency and
immutability of the blockchain, as the project improves, the transparency would help improve estimates
closer to realistic value and the immutability will improve the sustainable development goals for blockchain
applications.[9] Our main objectives for the project were to measure and evaluate carbon emissions due to
