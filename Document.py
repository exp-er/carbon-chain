        ## Contextual Background

This paper examines blockchain operations based on the underlying algorithm, functionality,  run-time requirements, resource requirements, and future scopes. The core method for examination includes evaluating and measuring the carbon footprint of different underlying technologies with plausible models for evaluating carbon credits to offset emissions. Moreover, the paper aims to build indexing for corporations created or based on Blockchain for investment. The index helps develop and maintain a social image by examining corporations' carbon footprint and carbon offset credit usage, providing incentives to build a sustainable methodology for present and future operations. 

### Blockchain

Blockchain is a decentralised and distributed ledger shared among participating nodes for immutability, transparency, and high security. Blockchain's history can be traced back to Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency developed through P2P technology supported by different levels of securities to make it tamper-proof. The technology allowed Bitcoin to provide freedom of payment, with user-defined fees, less risk, transparent transactions between all parties, absolute security, and decentralised management. However, the operational requirements lead to increased energy consumption for the core organisation and the participating nodes, including the energy required for mining based on the consensus algorithm, network sharing, and storage requirements for processing and procuring the next steps. Blockchain has come a long way from supporting Bitcoin as a ledger. Blockchain has use cases ranging from decentralising institutions and corporations, supporting operations that require absolute trust to trust-free methods, and modular technologies that provide better insights. Blockchain technology works on a P2P system run by the users that support its computational requirements through mining. Hence, blockchain technology is run by the people, for the people, and to the people, giving democracy a technological facet.

However, the energy consumption of the operations concerns climate change, and the computational requirement for Blockchain leads to massive emissions in the form of electricity usage, leading to negative attention towards Blockchain through public purview. 
Moreover, as a disruptive technology, its use cases are underway for existing decentralising institutions while providing operational benefits to multiple current models that question the feasibility of the trade-off between the help of the technology and its adverse effects on the climate.

### Carbon Footprint 

The total amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere by an individual/corporation's operations. It is challenging to manage but important to calculate the carbon footprint production for all activities, meagre or essential. Given the climate crisis, it is crucial to reform activities into more efficient and sustainable alternatives. In this paper, we calculate carbon emissions throughout a corporation's or individual's activities with the Blockchain. For that, we understand the underlying processes of different blockchains and calculate emissions through each root element, averaging out the summation for the carbon footprint of a specific operation. The value and understanding of the operations, objectives, and requirements help us evaluate methods towards its reduction and innovation to shift to a more sustainable approach. 

The "Carbon Footprint" concept came from the concept of "Ecological Footprint" in the 1990s. As carbon footprint deals with CO2 per year, ecological footprint deals with emissions compared to what the planet can renew. It was popularised in 2005 by fossil fuel company BP when they ran an advertising campaign for individuals to calculate their carbon footprint and reduce it. This campaign worked to shift the blame of climate change and actions to individuals rather than corporations, but at the same time worked great as awareness about each individual's contribution to the climate crisis. The concept and requirements we are interested in starting with United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) in 1992. UNFCC is an international cooperation to combat climate change by adopting sustainable methods and replacing methods that harm the climate. UNFCC has proposed actions such as lowering emissions, achieving net-zero, innovations with alternate energies and carbon capture, and carbon offset credits for incentivised net-zero goals. Particularly Kyoto Protocol(1997/2005), Doha Amendment(2012), and Paris Agreement (2015) involved countries in climate-centric actions to safeguard the future. The Kyoto Protocol, discussed in 1997 and implemented in 2005, operationalises developed countries to limit emissions as per the agreed terms through a document binding them with their promises and penalties in case of failure. In the Doha Amendment(2012), additional actions were added to Kyoto Protocol, with more countries added for climate-centric actions and reduced GHG emissions target from 5% to 18%. Paris Agreement(2015) improves on the concept and is volunteered by almost every country(195) to reduce GHG emissions with climate-centric actions for a sustainable future. The Paris Agreement(2015) is not legally binding and is on a volunteer basis by the countries, and each country has presented their commitments depending on its situation. Moreover, the agreement incurs no penalties for failure, giving countries some leeway to do things properly rather than haphazard actions that could affect their development, with a single mindset of tackling the climate crisis.

The prominent effect of the climate crisis is increasing global temperature. The climate-centric actions proposed through UNFCC aim to reduce that effect as much as possible. This framework significantly impacts governments, policymakers, households, consumers, corporations, and investors. As such, this framework brings about duty challenges, risks with actions, and opportunities for the future. Various innovative methods are in development to tackle this framework and commitment efficiently. Natural and Man-made methods are in development to make the change seamless. In this paper, we examine disruptive technology, its role in contributing towards emissions, how to make it efficient and sustainable, and finally, what role it can play in tackling the emissions for itself and other industries. 

The current standard for calculating carbon footprint is evaluating emissions through the supply chain and employing organisations specifically for calculating the footprint, leading to an immense paper trail, costs, and time-consuming procedures. Moreover, these calculations are on volunteer practices rather than automated systems. Corporations share the objectives and the underlying operations they deem appropriate with companies that excel in calculating the carbon footprint. These companies perform fine-tuned calculations based on the operations and objectives of the corporations and produce a dashboard/report on their footprint. Hence, these footprints are the frame for perfection instead of being closer to reality. In this paper, we aim to design methodologies for automated carbon footprinting for corporations based on Blockchain technology. Given its transparency benefit, the report thus generated is accurate. We examine blockchain operations based on the underlying algorithm, functionality, run-time requirements, resource requirements, and future scopes. The core method for examination includes evaluating and measuring carbon footprint and building plausible models to offset the damages. Hence, evaluating companies' contribution, responsibility, and social images by examining carbon footprint and encouraging them to build a sustainable methodology for current and future blockchain operations. 


### Carbon Credits

Due to frameworks discussed at UNFCCC with participating countries and pledges to take climate-centric action towards a sustainable future, the reduction of emissions played a vital role, and it also led to the development of another concept of Carbon neutrality or net-zero goals. The term is defined using carbon emission standards. Positive carbon emission should equal negative carbon emission, leading to a net-zero emission globally. The term can be traced back to Kyoto Protocol(1997) when signatories adopted carbon offset credit using a cap-and-trade scheme by regulated authorities compared to being taxed for carbon emissions. Corporations were allotted carbon credits per year based on their operations and had to stay within that cap for their operations. If the corporation reached its "cap", it had to trade in more credits to stay under the limit. In the same way, if the corporation kept their emissions below the "cap", they could trade the surplus credits with other corporations. 

The Paris Agreement(2015) banked on a similar concept to advocate carbon neutrality/ net-zero goals for participating countries to offset carbon emissions and combat the climate crisis. COP26 at Glasgow led to a turning point in using Carbon Credits as the negotiators requested and approved a voluntary market for carbon credits. Hence, carbon credits are exchanged through a regulatory market between governments and corporations and a voluntary market through organisations or individuals that use multiple methods to create more carbon credits by offsetting their carbon footprint. 

Various methods for creating or attaining carbon credits have come under purview. Carbon credits can be developed by investing in renewable energy, improving efficiency, capturing carbon, returning biomass to the soil, promoting forest growth, and switching to alternative fuel types. Various technologies are developing to analyse carbon footprint and calculate the number of carbon credits required for offset. Organisations that solely focus on creating carbon credits to trade with individuals and corporations. The slow evolution of carbon markets between individuals and corporations provides financial incentives for sustainability.

The opportunities that carbon credits bring out as an investment for the future assist developing countries with the time and resources to provide incentives for sustainable methods while conforming to the agreement to deal with climate change. The current form of carbon credit is through a voluntary emission reduction market or a regulatory framework for offsetting emissions from a project. However, blockchain technology can provide an edge to the work of carbon credits to be more fair and decentralised with automated functionality for transparent transfer and emission calculation. Cryptocurrency in the form of tokens or coins could work as the currency for carbon credit exchanges. The trust-free and transparent benefit of Blockchain could give carbon credits the necessary boost for a fair market where corporations participate in creating carbon credits through multiple means rather than focusing on buying the offset. The technology can also help calculate carbon footprint accurately through the project's lifecycle, and better metrics will lead to better evaluation and profits.

In this paper, we evaluate carbon footprints for the underlying working of a Blockchain-based corporation and how it could be made sustainable and efficient given its feasibility. Moreover, based on our evaluation, we include carbon credits in the structure to make the operation carbon neutral.

### Carbon Index

To deal with the entire lifecycle of a sustainable future, with government policies that are regulated and amended for climate-centric actions through agreements at UNFCC. Corporations are working towards a net-zero lifecycle due to corporate social responsibilities and government regulations. Individuals are taking the initiative to offset their carbon emissions and create methods to earn carbon credits to support carbon markets. Finally, the subsequent step would be incentives for corporations to offset their carbons rather than just compulsory offsets mandated by the government. Even though regulatory carbon credits allow trading, the government fixed prices based on the fossil fuel, the project's requirement and net-zero goals. Hence, we propose another incentive through carbon indexes. 

With the evaluation of carbon footprint and the existence of carbon credits, this paper develops carbon-based indexing for Blockchain-based corporations or corporations employing Blockchain as their means of operation for core functionalities. These indexes incentives the corporation to shift towards a more sustainable approach. Startups can build better methods using alternative energies and create carbon credits or provide alternative methods of operations that conform to carbon neutrality norms. Individuals can invest in corporations that perform climate-centric, reducing their carbon emissions rather than just offsetting them through sheer profits. The indexing developed on the correlation between the existing carbon footprint with the organisation's carbon credit and sustainability rating. Hence, giving an edge to sustainable companies based on carbon footprints compared to unsustainable ones.
